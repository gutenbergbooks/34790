<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i1">Do you recall those bygone days,</span>
  <span class="i0">When you received with kindly praise</span>
  <span class="i2">My bantling book of Rhyme?</span>
  <span class="i0">Praise undeserved, alas! and yet</span>
  <span class="i0">How sweet! For, tho' we had not met,</span>
  <span class="i2">(Ah! what a waste of time!)</span>
  <span class="i0">I could the more enjoy such mercies</span>
  <span class="i0">Since I delighted in <i>your</i> verses.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">And when a Poet stoops to smile</span>
  <span class="i0">On some one of the rank and file,</span>
  <span class="i2">(Inglorious&mdash;if not mute,)</span>
  <span class="i0">Some groundling bard who craves to climb,</span>
  <span class="i0">Like me, the dizzy rungs of Rhyme,</span>
  <span class="i2">To reach the Golden Fruit;</span>
  <span class="i0">For one in such a situation</span>
  <span class="i0">The faintest praise is no damnation.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">Parnassus heights must surely pall;</span>
  <span class="i0">For simpler diet do you call,</span>
  <span class="i2">Of nectar growing tired?</span>
  <span class="i0">These verses to your feet I bring,</span>
  <span class="i0">Drawn from an unassuming spring,</span>
  <span class="i2">Well-meant&mdash;if not inspired;</span>
  <span class="i0">O charming Poet's charming daughter,</span>
  <span class="i0">Descend and taste my toast and water!</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">For you alone these lines I write,</span>
  <span class="i0">That, reading them, your brow may light</span>
  <span class="i2">Beneath its crown of bays;</span>
  <span class="i0">Your eyes may sparkle like a star,</span>
  <span class="i0">With friendship, that is dearer far</span>
  <span class="i2">Than any breath of praise;</span>
  <span class="i0">The which a lucky man possessing</span>
  <span class="i0">Can ask no higher human blessing.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">And, though the "salt estranging sea"</span>
  <span class="i0">Be widely spread 'twixt you and me,</span>
  <span class="i2">We have what makes amends;</span>
  <span class="i0">And since I am so glad of you,</span>
  <span class="i0">Be glad of me a little, too,</span>
  <span class="i2">Because of being friends.</span>
  <span class="i0">And, if I earn your approbation,</span>
  <span class="i0">Accept my humble dedication.</span>

<h3 class="p4"><i>Foreword</i></h3>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i1">The Press may pass my Verses by</span>
  <span class="i2">With sentiments of indignation,</span>
  <span class="i0">And say, like Greeks of old, that I</span>
  <span class="i2">Corrupt the Youthful Generation;</span>
  <span class="i0">I am unmoved by taunts like these&mdash;</span>
  <span class="i0">(And so, I think, was Socrates).</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">Howe'er the Critics may revile,</span>
  <span class="i2">I pick no journalistic quarrels,</span>
  <span class="i0">Quite realizing that my Style</span>
  <span class="i2">Makes up for any lack of Morals;</span>
  <span class="i0">For which I feel no shred of shame&mdash;</span>
  <span class="i0">(And Byron would have felt the same).</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">I don't intend a Child to read</span>
  <span class="i2">These lines, which are not for the Young;</span>
  <span class="i0">For, if I did, I should indeed</span>
  <span class="i2">Feel fully worthy to be hung.</span>
  <span class="i0">(Is "hanged" the perfect tense of "hang"?</span>
  <span class="i0">Correct me, Mr. Andrew Lang!)</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">O Young of Heart, tho' in your prime,</span>
  <span class="i2">By you these Verses may be seen!</span>
  <span class="i0">Accept the Moral with the Rhyme,</span>
  <span class="i2">And try to gather what I mean.</span>
  <span class="i0">But, if you can't, it won't hurt me!</span>
  <span class="i0">(And Browning would, I know, agree.)</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">Be reassured, I have not got</span>
  <span class="i2">The style of Stephen Phillips' heroes,</span>
  <span class="i0">Nor Henry Jones's pow'r of Plot,</span>
  <span class="i2">Nor wit like Arthur Wing Pinero's!</span>
  <span class="i0">(If so, I should not waste my time</span>
  <span class="i0">In writing you this sort of rhyme.)</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">I strive to paint things as they Are,</span>
  <span class="i2">Of Realism the true Apostle;</span>
  <span class="i0">All flow'ry metaphors I bar,</span>
  <span class="i2">Nor call the homely thrush a "throstle."</span>
  <span class="i0">Such synonyms would make me smile.</span>
  <span class="i0">(And so they would have made Carlyle.)</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">My Style may be at times, I own,</span>
  <span class="i2">A trifle cryptic or abstruse;</span>
  <span class="i0">In this I do not stand alone,</span>
  <span class="i2">And need but mention, in excuse,</span>
  <span class="i0">A thousand world-familiar names,</span>
  <span class="i0">From Meredith to Henry James.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">From these my fruitless fancy roams</span>
  <span class="i2">To seek the Ade of Modern Fable,</span>
  <span class="i0">From Doyle's or Hemans' "Stately Ho(l)mes,"</span>
  <span class="i2">To t'other of The Breakfast Table;</span>
  <span class="i0">Like Galahad, I wish (in vain)</span>
  <span class="i0">"My wit were as the wit of Twain!"</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">Had I but Whitman's rugged skill,</span>
  <span class="i2">(And managed to escape the Censor),</span>
  <span class="i0">The Accuracy of a Mill,</span>
  <span class="i2">The Reason of a Herbert Spencer,</span>
  <span class="i0">The literary talents even</span>
  <span class="i0">Of Sidney Lee or Leslie Stephen.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">The pow'r of Patmore's placid pen,</span>
  <span class="i2">Or Watson's gift of execration,</span>
  <span class="i0">The sugar of Le Gallienne,</span>
  <span class="i2">Or Algernon's Alliteration.</span>
  <span class="i0">One post there is I'd not be lost in,</span>
  <span class="i0">&mdash;Tho' I might find it most ex-austin'!</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">Some day, if I but study hard,</span>
  <span class="i2">The public, vanquished by my pen'll</span>
  <span class="i0">Acclaim me as a Minor Bard,</span>
  <span class="i2">Like Norman Gale or Mrs. Meynell,</span>
  <span class="i0">And listen to my lyre a-rippling</span>
  <span class="i0">Imperial banjo-spasms like Kipling.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">Were I a syndicate like K.</span>
  <span class="i2">Or flippant scholar like Augustine;</span>
  <span class="i0">Had I the style of Pater, say,</span>
  <span class="i2">Which ev'ryone would put their trust in,</span>
  <span class="i0">I'd love (as busy as a squirrel)</span>
  <span class="i0">To pate, to kipple, and to birrel.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">So don't ignore me. If you should,</span>
  <span class="i2">'Twill touch me to the very heart oh!</span>
  <span class="i0">To be as much misunderstood</span>
  <span class="i2">As once was Andrea del Sarto;</span>
  <span class="i0">Unrecognized to toil away,</span>
  <span class="i0">Like Millet&mdash;not, of course, Mill<i>ais</i>.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">And, pray, for Morals do not look</span>
  <span class="i2">In this unique agglomeration,</span>
  <span class="i0">&mdash;This unpretentious little book</span>
  <span class="i2">Of Infelicitous Quotation.</span>
  <span class="i0">I deem you foolish if you do,</span>
  <span class="i0">(And Mr. Russell thinks so, too).</span>
 </div>
</div>

<h3 class="p4"><i>"Virtue is Its Own Reward"</i></h3>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i1">Virtue its own reward? Alas!</span>
  <span class="i2">And what a poor one as a rule!</span>
  <span class="i0">Be Virtuous and Life will pass</span>
  <span class="i2">Like one long term of Sunday-School.</span>
  <span class="i0">(No prospect, truly, could one find</span>
  <span class="i0">More unalluring to the mind.)</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">You may imagine that it pays</span>
  <span class="i2">To practise Goodness. Not a bit!</span>
  <span class="i0">You cease receiving any praise</span>
  <span class="i2">When people have got used to it;</span>
  <span class="i0">'Tis generally understood</span>
  <span class="i0">You find it <i>easy</i> to be good.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">The Model Child has got to keep</span>
  <span class="i2">His fingers and his garments white;</span>
  <span class="i0">In church he may not go to sleep,</span>
  <span class="i2">Nor ask to stop up late at night.</span>
  <span class="i0">In fact he must not ever do</span>
  <span class="i0">A single thing he wishes to.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">He may not paddle in his boots,</span>
  <span class="i2">Like naughty children, at the Sea;</span>
  <span class="i0">The sweetness of Forbidden Fruits</span>
  <span class="i2">Is not, alas! for such as he.</span>
  <span class="i0">He watches, with pathetic eyes,</span>
  <span class="i0">His weaker brethren make mud-pies.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">He must not answer back, oh no!</span>
  <span class="i2">However rude grown-ups may be,</span>
  <span class="i0">But keep politely silent, tho'</span>
  <span class="i2">He brim with scathing repartee;</span>
  <span class="i0">For nothing is considered worse</span>
  <span class="i0">Than scoring off Mamma or Nurse.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">He must not eat too much at meals,</span>
  <span class="i2">Nor scatter crumbs upon the floor;</span>
  <span class="i0">However vacuous he feels,</span>
  <span class="i2">He may not pass his plate for more;</span>
  <span class="i0">&mdash;Not tho' his ev'ry organ ache</span>
  <span class="i0">For further slabs of Christmas cake.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">He is enjoined to choose his food</span>
  <span class="i2">From what is easy to digest;</span>
  <span class="i0">A choice which in itself is good,</span>
  <span class="i2">But never what <i>he</i> likes the best.</span>
  <span class="i0">(At times how madly he must wish</span>
  <span class="i0">For just <i>one</i> real unwholesome dish!)</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">And, when the wretched urchin plays</span>
  <span class="i2">With other little girls and boys,</span>
  <span class="i0">He has to show unselfish ways</span>
  <span class="i2">By giving them his choicest toys;</span>
  <span class="i0">His ears he lets them freely box,</span>
  <span class="i0">Or pull his lubricated locks.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">His face is always being washed,</span>
  <span class="i2">His hair perpetually brushed,</span>
  <span class="i0">And thus his brighter side is squashed,</span>
  <span class="i2">His human instincts warped and crushed;</span>
  <span class="i0">Small wonder that his early years</span>
  <span class="i0">Are filled with "thoughts too deep for tears."</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">He is commanded not to waste</span>
  <span class="i2">The fleeting hours of childhood's days</span>
  <span class="i0">By giving way to any taste</span>
  <span class="i2">For circuses or matinées;</span>
  <span class="i0">For him the entertainments planned</span>
  <span class="i0">Are "Lectures on the Holy Land."</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">He never reads a story book</span>
  <span class="i2">By Rider H. or Winston C.,</span>
  <span class="i0">In vain upon his desk you'd look</span>
  <span class="i2">For tales by Richard Harding D.;</span>
  <span class="i0">Nor could you find upon his shelf</span>
  <span class="i0">The works of Rudyard&mdash;or myself!</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">He always fears that he may do</span>
  <span class="i2">Some action that is <i>infra dig.</i>,</span>
  <span class="i0">And so he lives his short life through</span>
  <span class="i2">In the most noxious rôle of Prig.</span>
  <span class="i0">("Short life" I say, for it's agreed</span>
  <span class="i0">The Good die very young indeed.)</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">Ah me! How sad it is to think</span>
  <span class="i2">He could have lived like me&mdash;or you!</span>
  <span class="i0">With practice and a taste for drink,</span>
  <span class="i2">Our joys he might have known, he too!</span>
  <span class="i0">And shared the pleasure <i>we</i> have had</span>
  <span class="i0">In being gloriously bad!</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">The Naughty Boy gets much delight</span>
  <span class="i2">From doing what he should not do;</span>
  <span class="i0">But, as such conduct isn't Right,</span>
  <span class="i2">He sometimes suffers for it, too.</span>
  <span class="i0">Yet, what's a spanking to the fun</span>
  <span class="i0">Of leaving vital things Undone?</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">If he's notoriously bad,</span>
  <span class="i2">But for a day should change his ways,</span>
  <span class="i0">His parents will be all so glad,</span>
  <span class="i2">They'll shower him with gifts and praise!</span>
  <span class="i0">(It pays a connoisseur in crimes</span>
  <span class="i0">To be a perfect saint at times.)</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">Of course there always lies the chance</span>
  <span class="i2">That he is charged with being ill,</span>
  <span class="i0">And all his innocent romance</span>
  <span class="i2">Is ruined by a rhubarb pill.</span>
  <span class="i0">(Alas! 'Tis not alone the Good</span>
  <span class="i0">That are so much misunderstood.)</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">But, as a rule, when he behaves</span>
  <span class="i2">(Evincing no malarial signs),</span>
  <span class="i0">His friends are all his faithful slaves,</span>
  <span class="i2">Until he once again declines</span>
  <span class="i0">With easy conscience, more or less,</span>
  <span class="i0">To undiluted wickedness.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">The Wicked flourish like the bay,</span>
  <span class="i2">At Cards or Love they always win,</span>
  <span class="i0">Good Fortune dogs their steps all day,</span>
  <span class="i2">They fatten while the Good grow thin.</span>
  <span class="i0">The Righteous Man has much to bear;</span>
  <span class="i0">The Bad becomes a Bullionaire!</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">For, though he be the greatest sham,</span>
  <span class="i2">Luck favours him his whole life through;</span>
  <span class="i0">At "Bridge" he always makes a Slam</span>
  <span class="i2">After declaring "Sans atout";</span>
  <span class="i0">With ev'ry deal his fate has planned</span>
  <span class="i0">A hundred Aces in his hand.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">And it is always just the same;</span>
  <span class="i2">He somehow manages to win,</span>
  <span class="i0">By mere good fortune, any game</span>
  <span class="i2">That he may be competing in.</span>
  <span class="i0">At Golf no bunker breaks his club,</span>
  <span class="i0">For him the green provides no "rub."</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">At Billiards, too, he flukes away</span>
  <span class="i2">(With quite unnecessary "side");</span>
  <span class="i0">No matter what he tries to play,</span>
  <span class="i2">For him the pockets open wide;</span>
  <span class="i0">He never finds both balls in baulk,</span>
  <span class="i0">Or makes miss-cues for want of chalk.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">He swears; he very likely bets;</span>
  <span class="i2">He even wears a flaming necktie;</span>
  <span class="i0">Inhales Egyptian cigarettes</span>
  <span class="i2">And has a "Mens Inconscia Recti";</span>
  <span class="i0">Yet, spite of all, one must confess</span>
  <span class="i0">That naught succeeds like his excess.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">There's no occasion to be Just,</span>
  <span class="i2">No need for motives that are fine,</span>
  <span class="i0">To be Director of a Trust,</span>
  <span class="i2">Or Manager of a Combine;</span>
  <span class="i0">Your corner is a public curse,</span>
  <span class="i0">Perhaps; but it will fill your purse.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">Then stride across the Public's bones,</span>
  <span class="i2">Crush all opponents under you,</span>
  <span class="i0">Until you "rise on stepping-stones</span>
  <span class="i2">Of their dead selves"; and, when you do,</span>
  <span class="i0">The widow's and the orphan's tears</span>
  <span class="i0">Shall comfort your declining years!</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">But having had your boom in oil,</span>
  <span class="i2">And made your millions out of it,</span>
  <span class="i0">Would you propose to cease from toil?</span>
  <span class="i2">Great Vanderfeller! Not a bit!</span>
  <span class="i0">You've <i>got</i> to labour, day and night,</span>
  <span class="i0">Until you die&mdash;and serve you right!</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">Then, when you stop this frenzied race,</span>
  <span class="i2">And others in your office sit,</span>
  <span class="i0">You'll leave the world a better place,</span>
  <span class="i2">&mdash;The better for your leaving it!</span>
  <span class="i0">For there's a chance perhaps your heir</span>
  <span class="i0">May spend what you've collected there.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">Myself, how lucky I must be,</span>
  <span class="i2">That need not fear so gross an end;</span>
  <span class="i0">Since Fortune has not favoured me</span>
  <span class="i2">With many million pounds to spend.</span>
  <span class="i0">(Still, did that fickle Dame relent,</span>
  <span class="i0">I'd show you how they <i>should</i> be spent!)</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">I am not saint enough to feel</span>
  <span class="i2">My shoulder ripen to a wing,</span>
  <span class="i0">Nor have I wits enough to steal</span>
  <span class="i2">His title from the Copper King;</span>
  <span class="i0">And there's a vasty gulf between</span>
  <span class="i0">The Man I Am and Might Have Been;</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">But tho' at dinner I may take</span>
  <span class="i2">Too much of Heidsieck (extra dry),</span>
  <span class="i0">And underneath the table make</span>
  <span class="i2">My simple couch just where I lie,</span>
  <span class="i0">My mode of roosting on the floor</span>
  <span class="i0">Is just a trick and nothing more.</span>
 </div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">And when, not Wisely but too Well,</span>
  <span class="i2">My thirst I have contrived to quench,</span>
  <span class="i0">The stories I am apt to tell</span>
  <span class="i2">May be, perhaps, a trifle French;</span>
  <span class="i0">(For 'tis in anecdote, no doubt,</span>
  <span class="i0">That what's Bred in the Beaune comes out.)</span>

  <span class="i1">'Tis done! We reach the final page,</span>
  <span class="i2">With feelings of relief, I'm certain;</span>
  <span class="i0">And there arrives at such a stage,</span>
  <span class="i2">The moment to ring down the curtain.</span>

  <span class="i0">The Book perused, our Future brings</span>
  <span class="i2">A plethora of blank to-morrows,</span>

  <span class="i2">To write a Moral Book some day;</span>
  <span class="i0">What says the Bard? "The best laid schemes</span>
